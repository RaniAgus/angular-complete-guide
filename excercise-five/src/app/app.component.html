<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">1. Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">2. The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">3. When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emmited each second (ref = setInterval())</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">4. The event should be listenable from outside the component</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">5. When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">6. A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even component (on even numbers)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">7. Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">8. Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components</li>
